## **Phase 1: Create Public Portfolio Version**
### Tasks:
1. **Outline the public version's scope**:
   - Decide which features to showcase. `DONE`
   - Identify sensitive aspects to omit. `DONE`

2. **Set up a public GitHub repository**:
   - Create a new repository for the demo version. `DONE`
   - Create a comparison of Human VS. AI Scheduling [PROJECT HERE](sub_tasks\human_vs_ai_optimized_comparison.md) `IN PROGRESS`
   - Create ALTR downloadable example with example data that can be run to create a schedule
   - Add a README file with high-level details (use the provided structure as a guide). 

3. **Prepare code for public release**:
   - Remove proprietary algorithms and sensitive logic.
   - Include only generalized code and concepts.
   - Add sample data for demonstration purposes.

4. **Create visual assets**:
   - Generate sample outputs (e.g., schedule visualizations, data tables).
   - Save visuals (e.g., PNG, PDF) to the repository.

5. **Document your app**:
   - Write a concise and informative README file.
   - Add code comments where necessary.
   - Create a folder for images, outputs, or other non-code assets.

## **Phase 2: Protect Proprietary Code**
### Tasks:
1. **Create a private GitHub repository**:
   - Add the full implementation to this repository.
   - Enable access restrictions for confidentiality.

2. **Draft a sharing protocol**:
   - Prepare a brief NDA template for granting access when needed.
   - Decide under which circumstances youâ€™ll share the private repository (e.g., during job interviews).

## **Phase 3: Create Supporting Materials**
### Tasks:
1. **Demo video/presentation**:
   - Record a walkthrough of the app using dummy data.
   - Highlight its features and functionality.
   - Focus on problem-solving and results without exposing sensitive methods.

2. **Write a blog or portfolio entry**:
   - Summarize the challenges solved by your app.
   - Highlight your technical expertise in Python, RL, and optimization.
   - Avoid technical depth that reveals proprietary solutions.

## **Phase 5: Interview Preparation**
### Tasks:
1. **Prepare talking points**:
   - Be ready to explain the app's purpose, challenges solved, and results.
   - Use diagrams or pseudo-code to explain high-level design.

2. **Plan a live demo**:
   - Use the public version to walk through the app in interviews.
   - Show sample outputs and explain their significance.

3. **Be selective**:
   - Share private code only with trustworthy companies and under NDA.
