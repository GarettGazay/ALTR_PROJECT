## **What is the RPM score:**
An RPM score of N means that, on average, N rides are completed for every mile traveled. A higher RPM score indicates better efficiency, with more rides completed per mile, suggesting optimized routes and reduced travel distances. It reflects how well the system minimizes mileage while maximizing the number of rides.

Certainly! Here's the revised version of your original statement using **optimized rides** and **outlier rides**:

## **Optimized Rides vs. Outlier Rides**
There are two situations that come up when applying optimization to the ride scheduling problem as I've approached it. The **optimized rides** represent the core group that the model focuses on to generate an overall optimized schedule, ensuring efficiency in terms of mileage and time. The **outlier rides**, on the other hand, represent rides that deviate from the optimization due to factors like high mileage or low time efficiency. These outlier rides typically don't fit into the final schedule and are labeled "HUMAN" to indicate that human intervention is needed. From there, humans can assess whether these rides should be performed by adding an additional asset, or if they should be outsourced to a subcontractor, etc.
