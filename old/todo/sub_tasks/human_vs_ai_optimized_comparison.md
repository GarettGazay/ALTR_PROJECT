### **To-Do: Create Manual vs. AI-Optimized Schedule Comparison**

1. **Simulate a Manual Schedule**  
   - Create a sample set of rides with realistic constraints (e.g., time slots, driver availability).  
   - Manually assign rides using typical dispatcher practices (e.g., assigning the closest driver, no overall optimization).  
   - Document inefficiencies such as:  
     - Gaps in schedules.  
     - Overlapping rides.  
     - High mileage.  

2. **Generate an AI-Optimized Schedule**  
   - Input the same ride data into ALTR with identical constraints.  
   - Allow ALTR to optimize the schedule based on defined parameters like mileage, on-time performance, and driver utilization.  

3. **Visualize the Comparison**  
   - Create two **Gantt charts** to represent manual and AI schedules side-by-side.  
   - Generate additional visualizations (e.g., bar or pie charts) showing metrics such as:  
     - Total mileage.  
     - On-time performance rate.  
     - Driver utilization rate.  

4. **Analyze and Highlight Key Differences**  
   - Compare the schedules to identify improvements made by ALTR.  
   - Summarize key metrics in a table or narrative form.  

5. **Incorporate into Documentation or Presentation**  
   - Add visualizations and data analysis to the "In Action" section of the ALTR documentation.  
   - Include an explanation of how ALTR achieves efficiency gains compared to manual scheduling.  

6. **Optional: Simulate Additional Scenarios**  
   - Test and compare schedules with varying levels of complexity to demonstrate scalability.
