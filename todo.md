# To-Do List: Illustrating the Value of Your AI Model

## 1. Define the Narrative
- Clearly articulate the problem your AI solves (e.g., inefficient ride scheduling).
- Highlight key benefits: mileage reduction, improved time efficiency, and balanced resource usage.

## 2. Metrics Visualization
- **Prepare Key Graphs:**
  - Reward growth over episodes (e.g., line graph). `YOU ARE HERE`
  - Mileage minimization (e.g., bar chart or scatter plot).
  - Ride distribution across assets (e.g., bar chart or variance metric).
  - On-time performance rates (e.g., pie or bar chart).
- **Automate Data Handling:**
  - Create scripts to extract and visualize data (use Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Streamlit).

## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Baseline Comparison:**
  - Compare the modelâ€™s performance to heuristic or random scheduling.
  - Show improvement in mileage, efficiency, and asset utilization.
- **Scalability Demonstration:**
  - Highlight performance with increasing ride volumes or limited assets.
  - Include edge case scenarios (e.g., peak scheduling times).

## 4. Real-World Simulation
- Simulate scheduling scenarios using real or synthetic datasets.
- Show step-by-step decision-making by the agent for a specific example.
- Use visual tools (e.g., animations or graphs) to make decisions intuitive.

## 5. Dashboard Development
- Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit):
  - Display live metrics (e.g., rides scheduled, mileage saved).
  - Allow users to explore specific scenarios.

## 6. Success Story & ROI
- Calculate operational savings (e.g., fuel costs, time saved).
- Provide a "before vs. after" comparison for stakeholders.
- Highlight how the AI improves customer satisfaction (e.g., on-time rides).

## 7. Presentation
- **Prepare Slides or Reports:**
  - Include key graphs, metrics, and visualizations.
  - Use concise language to explain results and benefits.
- **Live Demo:**
  - Showcase the trained model in action, solving a scheduling problem.

## 8. Feedback & Iteration
- Gather feedback from stakeholders on the presentation.
- Iterate on the visuals, narratives, or dashboard based on their input.
