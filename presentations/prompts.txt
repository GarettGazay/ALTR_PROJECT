I have an interview coming up, you know, sweet with a non-emergency medical transportation company, software and a vendor who is looking to incorporate a more intelligent aspect. I interviewed an industry expert today and got a lot of feedback. I made your help to distill down all of the information that I was given into a point by a point, companion guide, to give me on-screen pointers as I am in the meeting. I'm going to paste several of the sections and I want you to give me each section back, summarized and bullet-pointed. Please provide .md code for my on screen guide for all responses, here is the first section, which is just notes for me to start the meeting.

## **ALTR PRESENTATION POINT BY POINT**

### **Interview Structure from the Prospect's Point of View**
- Start by evaluating if I'm the right fit for solving the problem:
  - *"So what are you looking to do exactly?"*

- Ask about their current objectives and pain points:
  - *"What specific challenges or pain points are you currently facing?"*

- Explore their vision for AI:
  - *"How do you envision AI improving your current operations?"*
